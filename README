lmdb_freebase_mapper
--------------------

Just a small collection of scripts to load movies and actors from lmdb which have a foaf:page relation to the freebase portal. Each subgraph is selected and persisted locally, the result is a reference mapping and the single datasets can be used to evaluate different matching strategies.

This is my first project written in python so ... u know :)

And if someone wants to use the scripts or parts of it, feel free to do so.
