A collection of classes and functions to work with different movie portals,
like freebase, imdb or linked moviedatabase.

The need is to select subsets of each movie graph which maps to a subset in
another movie graph. These reference mappings are then used for further
evaluation of different matching algorithms.

This is my first project written in python so ... u know :)

Requirements
------------

- sparqlwrapper
- imdbpy
- google-api-python-client
